# dotRotator

So, my son and I were watching a youtube video one day ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZN1ors__s&t=18s ).

It was all about randomly putting dots on a piece of paper. After doing that you would take a piece of acetate and duplicate all the dots you made. When rotating or moving the second copy it creates images that look like spiral galaxies and other star like images. It was pretty cool.

I turned to my son and said, you know Im gonna be making this in javascript. He nodded... he knows me well :)

So, here it is.


# Instructions:

Arrows keys move the second image.

Holding shift will allow you to scale the secondary image as well as rotate it.
